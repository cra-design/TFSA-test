                            <p>If at any time in the calendar year your investment is or  becomes prohibited, it will be <strong>taxable at 50%</strong>  of the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the investment.</p>
                              <p>To calculate the amount you owe, complete and submit a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">TFSA Return (RC243)</a>, including &ldquo;Part D – Tax on prohibited investments&rdquo;.</p>
                       <p>If a prohibited investment stops being prohibited, the trust is considered to have disposed of the prohibited  investment and immediately re-acquired it as a permitted investment at FMV.</p>
                              <p>If the prohibited investment earns any income or has capital gains, you will also be liable for the <strong>100% advantage tax</strong>.</p>

                              <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  prohibited investment if the investment was disposed of or stopped being  prohibited <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year it  was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).</p>

                            <p>The CRA will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  prohibited.</p>
                              <p>If the tax on the prohibited investment and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the <strong>same calendar year</strong>, then you do not have to pay the tax. However, you must still file a TFSA Return. </p>

                            <h4>How  to request a refund</h4>
                              <p>To request a refund of the 50% tax on a prohibited  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243).</p>
                              <p>Be sure to attach documents that detail when the  investment was acquired and disposed of, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Name and description of the  investment</li>
                              <li>Number of shares or units</li>
                              <li>Date the investment was acquired or  became prohibited</li>
                              <li>Date the investment was disposed  of or became prohibited</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you disposed of the prohibited investment <strong>in the same year</strong> you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in  Section 2 of the TFSA Return and attach documents.</p>
                            <p>The refund only applies to the 50% tax on prohibited  investments, not the 100% tax on an advantage.</p>

                            <h3>Tax you may owe on a non-qualified investment</h3>
                            <p>If a TFSA trust acquires an investment that is or becomes non-qualified, it will be <strong>taxable at 50%</strong> of the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the investment at the time it was acquired or became  non-qualified.</p>
                              <p>To calculate the amount you owe, complete and submit a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">TFSA Return (RC243)</a>, including &ldquo;Part C – Tax on non-qualified investments&rdquo;. Do not report any increase in the value of a non-qualified investment at the time it is disposed on the TFSA Return. This is taxable to the trustee. </p>
                      <p>You may also have to pay a <strong>100% advantage</strong> tax on any income the investment earns if that income is not withdrawn from the account promptly. </p>
                      <p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#toc3">How an advantage is taxed</a> </p>
                             

                            <h4 class="h5">If your investment is also prohibited </h4>
                            <p>If an investment is both non-qualified and prohibited,  the CRA will treat it like a prohibited investment.</p>
                            <p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#toc1">How prohibited  investments are taxed</a></p>

                            <h4>TFSA issuers must inform holders </h4>
                            <p>TFSA issuers must take care to minimize the possibility that a TFSA trust holds non-qualified investments. They must notify you before March of the following year if the TFSA acquired or disposed of a non-qualified  investment, or if an investment became or stopped being non-qualified.</p>
                      <p> Any gains made through a non-qualified TFSA investment are taxable to the trustee using a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3RET)</a>. However, the trustee may recoup these amounts from the TFSA, reducing its value.  </p>
                    

                            <h3 id="toc22">Refund on non-qualified investment tax</h3>
                            <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  non-qualified investment if the investment was disposed of or stopped being  non-qualified <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year  it was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).  </p>

                              <summary>Details on requesting a tax refund on a non-qualified investment</summary>
                              <p>The CRA will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  non-qualified.</p>
                              <p>If the tax  on the non-qualified investment and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the same calendar year, then you don't have to pay the tax. However, you must still file a TFSA Return.</p>


                              <h4>How  to request a refund</h4>
                              <p>To request a refund of the 50% tax on a non-qualified  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243). Be sure to attach documents that detail when the investment was  acquired and disposed of, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Name and description of the  investment </li>
                              <li>Number of shares or units </li>
                              <li>Date the investment was acquired or  became non-qualified  </li>
                              <li>Date the investment was disposed  of or became qualified  </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you disposed of the non-qualified investment in the  same year you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in Section 2  of the TFSA Return and attach documents.</p>

                            <p>TFSA holders must avoid investments or transactions that are structured in way to artificially shift value into or out of the TFSA or result in certain advantages. An advantage can be a benefit or a debt that is conditional on the existence of the TFSA, subject  to certain exceptions for normal investment activities and conventional  incentive programs.</p>

                              <p> An  advantage can include any benefit that is an increase in the total <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the property of the TFSA that is reasonably attributable to any  one of the following:</p>

                              <li>A payment received in substitution  for a payment for services rendered by the holder (or non-arm&rsquo;s length person)  or for a return on investment on non-registered property </li>

                            <p>You don't usually pay tax on the income you earn in your TFSA. But there are situations where tax may apply.</p>
                            <p>A TFSA may be taxable if you have <strong>any</strong> of the following in your account:</p>

                            <dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
      <dt>Excess amount</dt>

                            <p>If you owe tax on your TFSA, you  must complete and file a TFSA Return (Form RC243) by <strong>June 30</strong> of the calendar year after the year the tax applies. The TFSA Return can help you  calculate the amount of tax you owe. Depending on your situation, you may  also need to complete and submit additional schedules.</p>

                            <p>The CRA may  waive or cancel all or part of the tax on a TFSA if we determine that it is fair to do  so. We will review your situation to determine:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>If the tax arose because of a reasonable error</li>
                              <li>The extent to which the transaction(s) that lead to the tax also lead to another tax under the <em>Income Tax Act</em></li>
                              <li>The extent to which withdrawals have been made from the TFSA to correct the error</li>
                            </ul>

<details>
                            <summary>What is a waiver or a cancellation</summary>
                             <p>A <strong>waiver </strong>is when the CRA grants a relief of  penalties and interest that you would otherwise have to pay before they are  assessed or charged to you.  It only  refers to tax paid under Part XI.01 of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>.</p>
                              <p>A <strong>cancellation </strong>is when the CRA grants a relief of  the penalties and interest that have already been assessed or charged to you.</p>

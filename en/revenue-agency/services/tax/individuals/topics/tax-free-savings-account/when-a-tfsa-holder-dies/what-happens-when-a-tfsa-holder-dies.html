                            <p>What happens after the death of a TFSA holder will vary according to the  situation. It is important to find out certain details about the TFSA to understand if there are any tax implications.</p>
                      <p>It is helpful to know the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>The type of TFSA</li>
                              <li>The type of  beneficiary(ies)</li>
                              <li>Whether any income was  earned after the date of death</li>
                              <li>How long, after the  date of death, before amounts are distributed to beneficiaries</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Depending on how the items above apply to your situation, they may affect  the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Whether the deceased holder&rsquo;s  TFSA continues to exist or is considered to have ended</li>
                              <li>How income earned  after the date of death can be reported and taxed</li>
                              <li>Whether a beneficiary  can contribute amounts they receive to their own TFSA, and whether the  contribution would affect their available contribution room</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 id="toc2">Different types of beneficiaries </h2>
                            <p>There are two types of TFSA beneficiaries:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0 dt-max">
  <dt>Successor holder</dt>
  <dd>The <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#survivor">survivor<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the deceased who is named as the new holder of the TFSA in the TFSA contract or will of the deceased holder</dd>
  <dt><span class="nowrap">Designated beneficiary</span></dt>
  <dd>A survivor (who is not a successor holder), family member, or other person or organization named as a beneficiary of the TFSA in the TFSA contract or will of the deceased holder </dd>
</dl>

     <p>Determining the type of beneficiary is the first important  step. The type of beneficiary can be determined by:</p>




                            <ul>
                              <li>Designations  that the deceased holder may have made in their TFSA contract</li>
                              <li>Terms of the deceased holder's will (if there is  one)</li>
                              <li>Succession legislation in the province or  territory of the deceased holder&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>TFSA holders who want to change a beneficiary designation  they made in the past should contact their TFSA issuer.</p>

                            <p>For more information:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <h3 id="toc21">Beneficiary designation in Quebec </h3>
                            <p>Quebec does not recognize the following designations for TFSAs:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Successor holder</li>

                                </ul>
                      <p>However, a surviving spouse or common-law partner in Quebec may still benefit  from the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#exemptcontribution">exempt  contribution<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> process.</p>

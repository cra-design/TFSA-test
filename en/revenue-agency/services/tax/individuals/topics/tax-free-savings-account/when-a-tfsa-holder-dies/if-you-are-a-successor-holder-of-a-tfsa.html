                            <h2 id="toc1">What is a successor holder </h2>
                            <p>A successor holder is the <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#survivor">survivor<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of  the deceased who is named as the new holder of the TFSA in either the TFSA contract or in the  will of the deceased holder.</p>
                            <p>The successor holder immediately becomes the new holder and  assumes ownership of the TFSA upon the death of the deceased holder. The  value of the TFSA on the date of death and any income earned after that date are still sheltered from tax under the new successor holder.</p>  
                      <p>Because the TFSA continues to exist, the deceased holder is not considered to receive an amount from the TFSA upon their death.</p>
                      <p>If the TFSA contract is a trust arrangement, the trust  continues to be the legal owner of the property held in the TFSA.</p>
                      
                              <p>The TFSA issuer will inform the CRA of the change in  ownership.</p>

                              <summary>Example of a successor holder</summary>
                              <p>Ginette and her husband Paul are both residents and live in a province that  recognizes TFSA beneficiary designations. Ginette is the holder of a TFSA and  has designated Paul as the successor holder.</p>
                              <p>Ginette dies on February 15, 2024. The <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of her TFSA  on that date is $10,000. There is no excess TFSA amount in her account. Her  estate is finally settled on September 1, 2024.  By that time, an additional $200 of income has been earned.</p>
                              <p>Since Paul  meets all the conditions, he becomes the successor  holder of Ginette&rsquo;s TFSA on the date of death.</p>
                              <p>The FMV of $10,000 on the date of death is not taxable to Paul. The $200 of income  earned after the date of death (and any subsequent income earned) is also not  taxable to Paul.</p>
                                  <p>Because Ginette was a resident at the time of her death and lived in a province that recognizes TFSA beneficiary designations, the CRA will not issue a T4A slip and will not require a Designation of an  Exempt Contribution – TFSA (Form RC240).</p>

                            <p>The successor holder may be named in the will of the deceased holder (instead of in the TFSA contract) if it states that the successor holds all the same rights as the original holder. This includes  the right to cancel or change any beneficiary designation the deceased holder  had chosen for the account or its assets.</p>

                            <h2 id="toc3">How contribution room is affected</h2>
                            <p>If the successor holder already has their own TFSA, they would  be considered to hold two separate TFSAs.</p>
                            <p>The successor holder&rsquo;s own available TFSA contribution room is not affected by becoming a successor holder as long as there is no excess amount in the deceased  holder&rsquo;s TFSA. </p>
                            <p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/when-a-tfsa-holder-dies/if-you-are-a-successor-holder-of-a-tfsa.html#toc2">If the deceased holder has an excess</a></p>
                      <p>If the successor holder has multiple TFSAs, their available contribution room now applies to all accounts collectively. The successor holder does not gain the deceased holder&rsquo;s unused contribution room, if there is any.</p>
                      <p>After taking over ownership of the deceased holder&rsquo;s TFSA, the successor holder can make  tax‑free withdrawals from that account. They can also make new contributions to that account if they have available contribution room. </p>                   
                       <p>The successor holder may ask the TFSA issuer to directly  transfer some or all of the value from one TFSA to the other and consolidate  the accounts. This would be a qualifying transfer and would <strong>not</strong> affect  their available TFSA contribution room.</p>
                     <p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/requesting-a-tfsa-transfer.html">Requesting a  TFSA transfer</a></p>

                            <p>An <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#excesstfsaamount">excess amount<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> can occur when a TFSA holder contributes  more than their available contribution room allows. If the deceased holder&rsquo;s  TFSA contains an excess amount at the time of death, there may be tax implications.</p>
                      <h3>Tax implications for the deceased holder</h3>
                              <p>Any excess amount is taxable to the deceased holder at a  rate of <strong> 1% per month</strong>  on the highest excess amount for each month it stays in  the account, up to and including the month of death. </p>
                          <p>The deceased holder&rsquo;s legal representative must file the following forms for that period:</p>

                            <ul>

                     <h3>Tax implications for the successor holder</h3> 
                      <p>At the beginning of the month after the date of death, the  successor holder  is considered to make a contribution to their TFSA that is equal to the excess amount that was in  the deceased holder&rsquo;s account.</p>
                              <p>If that contribution creates an excess amount in the  successor holder&rsquo;s account, it is taxable at a rate of <strong> 1% per month</strong> on the  highest amount for as long as the excess remains in the account.</p>

                                <p>At the beginning  of 2025, they each have an available TFSA contribution room of $7,000. Miriam contributes $7,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline  contributes $1,500 to hers.</p>
                                <h3 class="h6">June 2025</h3>
                              <p>On June 12, 2025, Miriam contributes an additional  $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2025 to $9,000.</p>
                              <p>As Miriam only has contribution room of $7,000 for 2025, she now has an excess TFSA amount of $2,000.</p>

                                <p>Miriam passes away on September 18, 2025. The value of  her TFSA on that date is $9,000. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be a successor holder,  she becomes the new holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2025.</p>

                                <p>Because there is an excess amount in Miriam&rsquo;s TFSA at the  time of her death, Pauline is deemed to make, on October 1, 2025, a $2,000  contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam&rsquo;s TFSA).</p>
                              <p>But because Pauline had previously only contributed $1,500  to her own TFSA, she still has $5,500 of unused contribution room available for  2025. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA  amount in her account.</p>

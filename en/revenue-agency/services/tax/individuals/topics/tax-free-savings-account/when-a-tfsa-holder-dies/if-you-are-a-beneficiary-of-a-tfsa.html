                              <li>The survivor uses the  form <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc240.html">Designation of an exempt contribution (Form RC420)</a> to determine the maximum amount that can be designated as an exempt  contribution </li>

                              <p>Beneficiaries who over-contribute to their own TFSA  may be taxed <strong>1% per month </strong> on the highest excess amount for each month it stays in the account. Always check your available contribution room before making a contribution.</p>

                            <p>When the donation is completed, the executor of the deceased holder&rsquo;s estate may ask the  CRA to change the deceased holder&rsquo;s income tax and benefit return for the year  of death to claim the charitable donation tax credit.</p>

                            <h2 id="toc2">Tax implications for the deceased holder</h2>
                            <p> If the deceased holder&rsquo;s TFSA contains an excess amount at the time of death, there are tax implications for their estate. An excess amount can occur when a TFSA holder contributes  more than their available contribution room allows. </p>
                              <p>An excess amount is taxable to the deceased holder at a  rate of <strong>1% per month</strong> on the highest excess amount for each month it stays in  the account, up to and including the month of death.</p>
                              <p>The deceased holder&rsquo;s legal representative must file the following forms for that period:</p>

                            <h2 id="toc3">Tax implications for the beneficiary</h2>
                            <p>A designated  beneficiary does not have to pay tax on any amount they receive from a TFSA as long as the total amount is not more than the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of  the property held in the TFSA on the date of death.</p>
                      <p>However, any earnings made after the date of death and before the estate is settled are taxable. The tax implications depend on the type of TFSA.</p>
                      <p>Beneficiaries should check with the TFSA issuer or with the deceased holder&rsquo;s legal representative to find  out what type of TFSA it is.</p>
                            <p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-test/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/what-is-a-tfsa.html#toc2">Different types of TFSAs</a></p>
                      
                            <h3>Taxes on a deposit or annuity contract TFSA </h3>
                            <p>If there is no  successor holder, the deposit or annuity contract stops existing when the  holder of the TFSA dies.</p>
                            <p>The deceased holder is considered to have disposed of their TFSA  immediately before the time of death for an amount equal to the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of all the property held in the TFSA at that time. The  deposit or annuity contract becomes a separate contract and is no longer considered  to be a TFSA.</p>
                              <p>All earnings that grow after the deceased holder&rsquo;s death are  taxable to the beneficiary.<br>
                              <p>Depending on the specific characteristics of the deposit or  annuity contract, the normal rules apply for reporting income or gains earned after  the date of death, such as reporting any interest earned on a T5, Statement of  Investment Income.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Taxes on an arrangement in trust TFSA </h3>
                            <p>If there is no successor holder, a TFSA that is an  arrangement in trust continues to exist and stays non-taxable until the end of  the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#exemptperiod">exempt period<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a>. However, income earned during the exempt period and  paid to beneficiaries is taxable income.</p>
                           
                            <p>This means that any amount up to the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> of the deceased holder&rsquo;s TFSA on the date of death can be  paid to beneficiaries without them having to report it as income. But any  amount paid to beneficiaries that is more than the FMV on the date of death is taxable and beneficiaries must report this as income. (These payments are in box 134 in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4a.html">T4A  Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income</a>.)</p>
                            <p>The trust must distribute both the  taxable and non-taxable amounts during the exempt period. The trustee will assign the part of each  payment that represents the non-taxable FMV at the date of death, with the rest being taxable.</p>     
                          <details>
                            <summary>If the trust exists after the exempt period</summary>
                            <p>If the trust continues to exist after the end of the exempt  period (for example, if not all amounts from the deceased&rsquo;s TFSA have been paid  to beneficiaries), it will be taxable from that point forward.</p>
                         
                            <p>After the exempt period ends, the trust becomes a taxable  inter-vivos trust (a living trust) with a tax year that begins January 1 of the  following calendar year. The trust will be treated as having disposed of and  immediately reacquired its property for its FMV at that time.</p>
                            <p>For as long as the trust continues to exist, it will be  taxable for any undistributed income. This includes any undistributed income or  gains in its first year, during the exempt period. </p>
                            <p>The trust will have to file a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3  Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3RET)</a> every tax year. It will  also have to prepare a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3.html">Statement  of Trust Income Allocations and Designations (T3)</a> in that year or later  years for any distribution of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.</p>

                      <h4 class="h5">Non-resident beneficiary</h4>
                            <p>If you are a non-resident beneficiary, including non-resident  survivor, you must report payment amounts you receive from the trust during the exempt period that are above the fair market value (FMV) of the TFSA. These payments are subject to non-resident withholding tax.</p>

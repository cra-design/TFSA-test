<h2 id="toc1">What is contribution room</h2>
<p>Your contribution room is the maximum amount you can contribute to your Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA). It is specific to you and can change each year, as well as when you make TFSA contributions and withdrawals.</p>

<p>If you have more than one TFSA, your contribution room is the total that you can contribute to all your accounts collectively. </p>
                
<h2 id="toc2">How contribution room accumulates</h2>
<p>If you are a resident of Canada, your contribution room starts to accumulate when you turn 18 years of age. This is when the <a href="#toc22">annual TFSA dollar limit</a>, which is set by the Government, becomes available to you as contribution room.</p>
<!--insert example here-->

<h4 class="h6">2023</h4>
<p>Joe is a resident of Canada. When he turned 18 years of age in 2023, he opened a TFSA.</p>
<p>The dollar limit was $6,500 in 2023 and Joe contributed the full amount. As a result, his contribution room was $0 for the rest of 2023.</p>

<h4 class="h6">2024</h4>
<p>In 2024, the new annual dollar limit was $7,000, so Joe now had $7,000 in available contribution room. But Joe had less money to invest this year and contributed only $2,000. This left him with an available contribution room of $5,000 for the rest of 2024.</p>

 <h3>New residents</h3>                       
<p>If you are a new resident of Canada, you start to accumulate contribution room on the day you have residency if you are 18 years of age or older.</p>

  <details>
  <summary>Example: Contribution room begins the year you have residency</summary>
  <p>David turned 40 in 2023 and became a resident of Canada the same year. In November of 2023, he received an inheritance and contributed $88,000 to a newly opened TFSA. He believed he was entitled to the total annual TFSA dollar limit since the program began in 2009.</p>
  <p>David did not know that the dollar limit only applies to him for the years he was a resident of Canada. Because David only became a resident of Canada in 2023, he only has $6,500 of available contribution room (the dollar limit for 2023).</p>

<h3>Non-residents</h3>                            
<p>If you are or become a non-resident who is 18 years of age or older and have a valid SIN, you may also accumulate contribution room if you make withdrawals, but it is <strong>not</strong> available to you until you have residency again.</p>
                            
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/before-you-contribute.html#toc4">Do not contribute if you are a non-resident</a></p>

                         
<h2 class="h3" id="toc22">Understanding the annual TFSA dollar limit</h2>

<p>New contribution room becomes available every calendar year when the Government of Canada assigns the annual dollar limit. The dollar limit is the same for all TFSA holders and is set every January 1.</p> <p>You may contribute up to the full amount of the dollar limit each year tax-free <strong>if</strong> you have the available contribution room. You may <strong>only</strong> contribute more than the annual dollar limit if you have unused contribution room still available from previous years.</p>

<h3>Contributions count against your available room</h3>
<p>Any contribution you make during the year immediately counts against your available contribution room. Meaning your contribution room will immediately decrease by the same amount that you contributed.</p>

<p>Any contribution you make over your available contribution room is an over-contribution and is taxable at a rate of 1% per month.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/how-to-contribute.html#toc2">How to avoid an over-contribution</a></li>

</ul> 

<h3>Withdrawals count towards next year's available room</h3>
<p>Any withdrawal you make during the calendar year is regained when it is carried over to <strong>next year’s</strong> available contribution room. Meaning your contribution room will increase on January 1 of the next year by the same amount that you withdrew.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/withdrawing-from-a-tfsa.html#toc1">How withdrawals affect contribution room</a></p>




<h3>Fees do not affect your room</h3>

<p>Management fees that you may have to pay related to your TFSA trust do not affect your contribution room. Fees are not considered to be TFSA contributions. And paying for investment advice, transfers or other fees is not considered to be a withdrawal.</p>


<h2 id="toc3">Types of permitted TFSA investments</h2>

<p>The types of investments that are permitted in a TFSA are generally the same as those permitted in a RRSP. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cash</li>
    <li>Mutual funds</li>
    <li>Securities listed on a designated stock exchange</li>
    <li>Guaranteed investment certificates</li>
    <li>Bonds</li>
    <li>Certain shares of small business corporations</li>
</ul>

<p>Investments that are <strong>not</strong> permitted include any investment that is or becomes prohibited, non-qualified or that has an advantage. Non-permitted TFSA investments are taxable.</p>

<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html">If you are taxed on non-permitted investments</a></p>

<h3>How some investments can affect your TFSA</h3>

<h4>Value of investment has no impact</h4>

<p>Changes in the value of your TFSA investments do <strong>not</strong> affect your contribution room.  Any earnings you make from your TFSA do not decrease your contribution room. Likewise, any losses you incur do not increase your contribution room.</p>

<details>
<summary>Example: Investment earnings do not affect contribution room</summary>

<p>Brayden was eager to open his TFSA, but he didn’t turn 18 until December 21, 2023.</p>
<h5 class="h6">2024 </h5> 
<p>On January 4, 2024, he opened a TFSA. His available contribution room was $13,500 (the combined maximum TFSA dollar limits for those years).</p>

<h4>Watch exchange rates of foreign funds</h4>

<p>You may contribute foreign funds to a TFSA. However, your financial institution will convert the funds to Canadian dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction when they report the information to us. The total amount of your TFSA contribution in Canadian dollars must not be more than your available contribution room. </p>

<h4>If you have a self-directed TFSA</h4>
<p>You may move some investments that you already have into your self-directed TFSA, but it is not always recommended. </p>

<h5 class="h6" id="rrsp">Do not transfer from your RRSP </h5>
<p>RRSP transfers count as income. If you transfer investments from your RRSP to your TFSA, you are considered to have withdrawn the investment from the RRSP at the fair market value (FMV).  This can have serious tax consequences. The withdrawal counts as income and must be reported in your Income Tax and Benefit Return for that year. You may claim the tax withheld on the withdrawal at line 43700 of your return. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If the transfer happens <strong>immediately</strong> after the withdrawal, the same value will be used as the amount of the contribution to the TFSA </li>
    <li>If the transfer happens <strong>later</strong>, the amount of the contribution will be the FMV of the investment at the time of the contribution </li>
</ul>    
<p>When an exchange is between two registered accounts (such as a RRSP and a TFSA), you cannot usually exchange securities for cash or for other securities of equal value.</p>
                            
<h5 class="h6">In-kind contributions must be qualified</h5>
<p>You may make in-kind contributions if they are <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#qualifiedinvestment">qualified investments<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>What is an in-kind contribution</summary>                            
<p>An in-kind contribution is a seamless transfer of assets (without selling them first) from your regular portfolio (a non-registered account) to your TFSA. Qualified in-kind contributions may include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Guaranteed investment certificates </li>
    <li>Government and corporate bonds </li>
    <li>Mutual funds </li>
    <li>Securities listed on a designated stock exchange </li>
</ul>
</details>

<p>An in-kind contribution is considered disposed of at <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> at the time of the contribution. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If the FMV is <strong>more</strong> than the cost of the property, you must report the capital gain in your income tax return and benefit return  </li>
    <li>If the FMV is <strong>less</strong> than the cost of the property, you cannot claim the capital loss </li>
</ul>
<p>The total amount of the contribution to your TFSA is equal to the FMV of the property. This contribution will immediately reduce your available contribution room by the same amount. </p>


                 
<h2 id="toc4">Do not contribute if you are a non-resident</h2>
<p>If you become a non-resident of Canada for income tax purposes, you <strong>cannot</strong> contribute to your TFSA. </p>

<p>Any unused contribution room you may have is no longer available to you as a non-resident. Contribution room is only available if you are a resident of Canada.</p>

<p>Any non-resident contribution that is not a <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#qualifyingtransfer">qualifying transfer<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> or an <a class="overlay-lnk" href="#exemptcontribution">exempt contribution<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> is taxed 1% for each month the contribution remains in the account. Non-residents may also be liable for other taxes. </p>

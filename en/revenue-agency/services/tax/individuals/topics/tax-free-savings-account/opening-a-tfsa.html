<h2 id="toc1">Who can open a TFSA</h2>
<p>Individuals who want to save and invest their money tax-free may open a Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA). You do not need to have earned income to open or contribute to a TFSA.</p>

<p>To be eligible to open a TFSA, you must: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Be a resident of Canada for income tax purposes</li>
    <li>Be 18 years of age or older </li>
    <li>Have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN) </li>
</ul>

<p>In some provinces and territories, you must be at least 19 years of age to enter a contract (such as a TFSA). In this case, after the individual turns 19, they may open a TFSA and carry over the contribution room of the year they turned 18.  </p>
<p>If you do not already have a CRA account, we recommend you register for one. Having a My Account and signing up for email notifications will allow us to contact you more easily if there are any issues with your contributions. </p>
                            <p>For more information:</p>
                            <ul>  
                                <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/register-cra-sign-in-services.html?account=mya">Register for a CRA account</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-individuals/online-mail-helping-you-organize-your-canada-revenue-agency-mail.html">Sign up for email notifications</a></li>
                            </ul>
<h3>If you are a new resident</h3>
<p>As a new resident of Canada, you may open a TFSA starting on the day you become a resident if you are 18 years of age or older. However, your contribution room only begins to accumulate in your year of residency (not the year you turn 18).</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/before-you-contribute.html#toc2">How contribution room accumulates</a></p>
<!--moved example to Before you contribute page-->
<h3>If you are a non-resident</h3>
<p>The TFSA is designed for individuals who are residents of Canada. As a non-resident, you may hold a TFSA if you are 18 years of age or older and have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN), but you cannot contribute to it tax-free.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/if-you-become-non-resident.html">How non-residency affects your TFSA</a></p>

<!--<h2 id="toc2">How TFSAs work</h2>
<p>When you open a TFSA, it is important to understand the basics of how to manage your contributions and withdrawals.</p>

 <ol class="lst-stps">
      <li>Open a TFSA with your financial institution</li>
      <li>Contribute to your TFSA when you have available contribution room in your account (otherwise you'll be taxed)</li>
      <li>Withdraw funds tax-free when you want</li>
     <li>Re-contribute to your TFSA when you have enough available contribution room again</li>
    </ol>-->

<!--<p>You may contribute to a TFSA at any time throughout the year. How much you are allowed to contribute will depend on how much <strong>available contribution room</strong> you have in your account.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="">Understand contribution room</a></p>-->

<h2 id="toc3">How to open a TFSA</h2>
<p>Banks, insurance companies, credit unions and trust companies can all issue TFSAs with different savings and investment options.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/what-is-a-tfsa.html#toc2">Different types of TFSA</a></p>

<p>To open a TFSA:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Contact a TFSA <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#issuer">issuer<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a></li>
    <li>Provide them with:
        <ul>
            <li>Your Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
            <li>Your date of birth</li>
            <li>Other supporting documents, as requested</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Your issuer may then register your <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#qualifyingarrangement">qualifying arrangement<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> with the Government of Canada as a TFSA.</p>

<h3>Provide accurate and complete information</h3>
<p>The issuer can deny your TFSA registration if you provide inaccurate or incomplete information. If your TFSA is <strong>not</strong> registered, any income it earns must be reported on your income tax and benefit return. </p>

<h2 id="toc4">How to close a TFSA</h2>
<p>You may close your TFSA if you no longer wish to have it. If your TFSA is locked into an investment for a specific period of time, you may need to discuss options with your issuer and they may charge a penalty or fee for closing the account.  </p>
<p>To close a TFSA:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Contact your TFSA issuer</li>
  <li>Withdraw all remaining funds</li>
  <li>Request the account be closed</li>
</ol>

<p>Any funds you withdraw are tax-free as long as there are no excess amounts, non-resident contributions or non-permitted investments in the account.</p>
